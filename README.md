# Wikipedia WebScrapping Learning Repository
I am using this project as a stepping stone for a larger project which I hope to complete during the Winter break of the 2021-2022 academic year by getting me more familiar with web scrapping, requests, beautiful soup, and python more generally. 

The purpose of this project is two-fold. 

First, I want to be able to scrape the list of US presidents wikipedia page to get the wikipedia article links to all of the US Presidents. Then, using thoose article links, I want to figure out which US president has the longest wikipedia page.

Second, I am going to go through all the people listed in the SMU people wikipedia page and go through all of their wikipedia pages and collect some metadata from each of the pages. I think that this will be a more difficult task than the first page becuase some of the people will not have wikipedia pages. Further, the more details I intned to get from the paegs will require more complex ways to store the data.
